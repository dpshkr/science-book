Density of States in 2D Semiconductors
=======================================

Before going to physics, let us derive a simple result from geometry.
Consider two circles defined by :math:`x^2 + y^2 = E` and
:math:`x^2 + y^2 = E + dE` where :math:`E \ge 0` and :math:`dE \ge 0`.
These circles are shown in the figure below.
We want to calculate the area of the ring defined by the circles,
which is shown in the hatched region of the figure.
Area of the larger circle is :math:`\pi(E+dE)`
and the smaller circle is :math:`\pi E`.
Area of the ring is given by the difference between the two, i.e.,
:math:`\pi(E+dE) - \pi E = \pi dE`.
We can therefore see that, the area of the ring is only
defined by :math:`dE` and not :math:`E`.


The Bornâ€“von Karman boundary condition
---------------------------------------

In the previous section, while evaluating the quantum states of a
2D system, we assumed the sheet to be infinite in extent in the
:math:`x-y` plane.
As a result we stated that both :math:`k_x` and :math:`k_y` are continuous real numbers.
However now we will consider the sheet to be a square of dimensions :math:`L \times L`.
When we do this, it is clear that :math:`\Psi_{xy}` can no longer be described by :math:`e^{i(k_xx + k_yy)}`.
This is so because thsi function is infinite in extent, while our sheet is finite.

To accurately describe the wavefunction, we need to know the boundary conditions of the system.
