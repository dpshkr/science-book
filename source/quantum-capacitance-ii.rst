Equivalent Circuit Model 
=========================

In the previous section, we have derived the following formula for change in electrochemical potential 
for a 2D conductor/semiconductor on the addition of additional electron charge density -

.. math ::
  \delta E_F = e\delta \phi_e + \frac{\delta \sigma_e}{D_0}

The first term is due to Coulomb forces, while the second is due to the Pauli exclusion principle.
The Pauli exclusion principle prohibits us from depositing the new electrons into filled electron states and hence provide 
additional energy to deposit them in the higher energy unfilled states.

We know that the first term depends only on the geometry of the conductor and hence can be represented by the classical equation - 

.. math ::
  \delta \phi_e = C_0 \delta \sigma_e

where :math:`C_0` is the electrostatic capacitance per unit area.
