Quantum Capacitance of 2D Material
==================================

Now, we will derive an expression for the quantum capacitance of a 2D material.
Consider a netral isolated sheet of degenerately doped 2D semiconductor of area :math:`A`.
Let the geometric capacitance of the sheet per unit area be :math:`C_0`.
The equilibrium condition of the sheet is shown in the left side of the figure below.
The density of states :math:`D(E)` is plotted as a function of energy :math:`E`.
The total number of free electrons is represented by the area under the blue curve in the figure.

Now we put a :math:`\delta N` number of electrons per unit area on the sheet.
