Quantum Capacitance
====================

Consider a very small quantum dot of radius :math:`R`.
The quantum dot's energy levels (band diagram) are shown in the figure below.
Because of its small size, it has quantized energy levels denoted by :math:`E_1`, :math:`E_2` and so on.
Suppose we put an electron in it. 
The electron occupies the first energy level :math:`E_1`. 
The quantum dot is now charged. 
As a result, the quantum dot now possesses electrostatic potential energy given by
:math:`\delta \phi_e = -\frac{e}{4\pi\epsilon_0R} = -\frac{e}{C_0}`, where :math:`e` is the absolute value of fundamental electron charge.
This is shown on the right side of the band diagram where all the bands are shifted by :math:`-e\delta \phi_e`.

Now we want to put a second electron. 
Already, the electron needs to possess an additional energy of :math:`-e\phi_e` 
to be deposited now, as the band diagram has shifted upwards.
This shift in all the energy levels due to electrostatic potential is what is 
captured by the geometrical/electrostatic capacitance.
However, we must remember that the second electron cannot be put at the level :math:`E_1`.
This follows from the famous Pauli exclusion principle.
